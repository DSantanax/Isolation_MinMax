    Requirements:
- Your computer is required to prompt for â€œWho goes first, C for computer, O for opponent:
- Your computer will be required to make its move within 20 seconds.
- The board will be 8 x 8 with the coordinate A1 indicating the top left hand side of the board.
- The user interface must display the game as demonstrated above
- When a new game starts, It must prompt for the time limit per move and prompt for who goes first
(computer or opponent)
- Moves must be entered as shown above
- The game must be implemented using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- It will help if you also implement this with an iterative deepening.
